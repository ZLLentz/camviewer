AD  - An AreaDetector camera.  The image data is bytes in ArrayData,
      and the dimensions are in ArraySize0_RBV, ArraySize1_RBV, and 
      ArraySize2_RBV.  If color, these are 3, X, Y, and if B/W, these 
      are X, Y, 0.

GE is a backwards compatible alias for AD.

All other types have been removed.
-----------------------------------------------------------
We are now dealing with some camera-specific control information as well.  In
the GE case, these PVs have a different basename than the image PVs, so we have
added the "IMAGE;CONTROL" syntax to the camera config file to specify the two
base names.  If the name has no semicolon, it will be assumed that the control
PVs and the image PVs have the same base.

For a GE camera, the PVs of interest are:
	TriggerMode{,_RBV}     - The triggering mode (Free Run, Sync In {1-4},
                                 Fixed Rate, Software)
	Gain{,_RBV}            - The camera gain.
        AcquireTime{,_RBV}     - The acquisition time (s).
        AcquirePeriod{,_RBV}   - The time between acquisitions (s).
	Cross{1,2}{X,Y}{,_RBV} - The global marker positions IN LANDSCAPE COORDINATES.
