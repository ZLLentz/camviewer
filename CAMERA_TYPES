LIF - A camera supporting a connection to LIVE_IMAGE_FULL, with N_OF_COL
      and N_OF_ROW being the image size.
AVG - A camera supporting LIVE_IMAGE_FULL and an on-IOC averaged AVG_IMAGE.
      N_OF_COL and N_OF_ROW are the image size, and AVERAGER.A is the number
      of frames to average.
IC  - A camera supporting a connection to IMAGE_CMPX, a compressed image.
      Control of the compression is via SHIFT.VAL (bit shift), ROI_X, ROI_Y,
      ROI_XNP, and ROI_YNP.  Images are <= 512x512.  Actual size is given
      by COMPRESSOR.VALE (rows) and COMPRESSOR.VALF (cols)
GE  - A gigE camera.  The image data is bytes in ArrayData, and the dimensions
      are in ArraySize0_RBV, ArraySize1_RBV, and ArraySize2_RBV.  If color,
      these are 3, X, Y, and if B/W, these are X, Y, 0.  No EVR!
MCC - Image is IMAGE, N_OF_COL, N_OF_ROW, and N_OF_BITS.  Or is this the ROI image?
      and so ROI_X,ROI_XNP, ROI_Y, ROI_YNP are the actual size of IMAGE?
LI  - Image is LIVE_IMAGE, size is N_OF_ROW/2, N_OF_COL/2.
LIO - Image is LIVE_IMAGE_12B, size is N_OF_ROW/2, N_OF_COL/2.
LIX - Image is LIVE_IMAGE_12B, size is ROI_XNP/2, ROI_YNP/2.
-----------------------------------------------------------
We are now dealing with some camera-specific control information as well.  In
the GE case, these PVs have a different basename than the image PVs, so we have
added the "IMAGE;CONTROL" syntax to the camera config file to specify the two
base names.  If the name has no semicolon, it will be assumed that the control
PVs and the image PVs have the same base.

For a GE camera, the PVs of interest are:
	TriggerMode{,_RBV}     - The triggering mode (Free Run, Sync In {1-4},
                                 Fixed Rate, Software)
	Gain{,_RBV}            - The camera gain.
        AcquireTime{,_RBV}     - The acquisition time (s).
        AcquirePeriod{,_RBV}   - The time between acquisitions (s).
	Cross{1,2}{X,Y}{,_RBV} - The global marker positions IN LANDSCAPE COORDINATES.

For an AVG camera, we have:
	Cross{1,2}{X,Y}{,_RBV} - The global marker positions IN LANDSCAPE COORDINATES.

For an AVG Pulnix, we have:
	Gain                   - The camera gain (0-100).
	Gain:Offset            - The difference in gain on the two halves. (A-, B+).
	Gain{A,B}              - The actual gains (between 0x42 (66) and 0x1e8 (488)).
	ShutterMode	       - Async=0 (triggered), Manual=1 (freerun), or Direct=2
				 (# of scan lines).
	Shutter		       - Speed (inverse 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000,
			 	 32000, 64000 or pulse for 0-9).

For an AVG Opal, we have:
	{Set,}GA               - The camera gain  (100-3200, representing 1x to 32x).
	{Set,}IT               - Integration time (0-32000 * 10us, if MO0)
	{Set,}FP               - Frame period     (0-32000 * 10us, if MO0)
	{Set,}MO               - Acquisition mode (0=continuous, 1=normal)
	{Set,}CCE	       - Exposure mode (n;m where n=4 is external I/O, 0-3 are CCn,
				 CameraLink Control signals, and m=0 is start on rising or
				 m=1 falling edge and end on reverse) Default: 4;0
	{Set,}CCFS	       - Readout control (n;m where n=0-3 are CCN, 4 is external I/O,
				 5 is software, and m=0 is start readout on falling or m=1
				 rising edge) Default: 0;0
